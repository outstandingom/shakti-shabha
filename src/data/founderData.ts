  genesisP1: 'Aaryaveera’s journey began at an early age through grassroots activism, youth engagement, and work across diverse institutional and cultural ecosystems. Her experiences in schools, colleges, community settings, and social initiatives exposed her to the complex challenges confronting young people, particularly women and adolescent girls.',
  genesisP2: 'She recognized that empowerment must go beyond temporary assistance, motivational slogans, or physical training. It must cultivate independent thinking, psychological resilience, personal responsibility, and the ability to make informed decisions. She also observed that women are often represented primarily through the lens of vulnerability, while their intellectual capabilities, leadership potential, courage, and inherent agency receive insufficient attention.',
  genesisP3: 'Through years of field engagement, Harshita evolved from collaborative grassroots activism towards independent institutional leadership, establishing Shakti Sabha as a platform dedicated to physical preparedness, intellectual independence, civilizational awareness, and human consciousness.',
  kshatraDharmaText: 'Her vision draws inspiration from the Indian civilizational principle of Kshatra-Dharma: the responsibility to protect, the courage to confront injustice, the discipline to exercise power responsibly, and the wisdom to distinguish strength from aggression. Her work brings together traditional knowledge systems, contemporary psychological perspectives, tactical self-defense education, and critical inquiry to help develop a generation that is physically capable, intellectually independent, and socially responsible.',
